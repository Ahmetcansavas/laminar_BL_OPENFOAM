# laminar_BL_OPENFOAM
this is laminar boundary layer using OpenFOAM's  icoFoam solver

the boundary condition u file are ...

we have zeroGradient  on the top and bottom of the entrance region
we have constant velocity on the left side of entrance region
we have zeroGradient on the top of the flat plate region and right hand side
we have noSlip condition on bottom of flat plate regÄ±on

for the future we want to include turbulence modelling ...let's see how we can do it. ( maybe we can do it in anotlher repository)
